Port by Kerey Roper (kerey@rivetinggames.com)

This is a rather straighforward port of AForge.NET to be compatible with the Unity3d game engine. I do not intend on maintaining or updating the code to track updates from upstream. Please contact me if this is something you would be interested in doing.

IMPORTANT: Glancing at my changes, it looks like I changed the semantics of the Range classes for negative numbers.
